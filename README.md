- Canonicalize RDF data.

## Getting Started

### Download and Install

You can run Corese-Command using Flathub or by downloading and executing the JAR file.

**Flathub:**

To install Corese-Command via Flathub, use the following command:

``` bash
flatpak install flathub fr.inria.corese.CoreseCommand
```

To run the application:

``` bash
flatpak run fr.inria.corese.CoreseCommand
```

For more information, visit the [Flathub page](https://flathub.org/apps/details/fr.inria.corese.CoreseCommand).

**JAR File:**

Download the latest version of the Corese-Command JAR from the [releases page](https://github.com/corese-stack/corese-command/releases) and run it with the following command:

``` bash
java -jar corese-command-4.5.0.jar
```

This will provide you with access to the Corese-Command interface.

## Usage

For a full list of available commands and options, use:

``` bash
java -jar corese-command-4.5.0.jar --help
```

> Create an alias for the JAR file to simplify the command `echo 'alias corese="java -jar path/to/corese-command-4.5.0.jar"' >> ~/.bashrc`
> After that, you can directly use the `corese` command to run Corese-Command.
> For example, `corese --help`.
